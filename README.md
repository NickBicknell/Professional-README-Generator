# Professional-README-Generator

## Description

I created the README generator application to make an efficent and effective way of quickly making a professional README.md file. By using NodeJS and inquirer the application will ask you a series of questions that takes the user input and dynamically gererates a professional README.md file. This project helped me become more confident using NodeJS, inquirer, and template literals. It also helped expand on my knowledge of README files to be able to create more a professional README in the future.

In a terminal like Git Bash, navigate to the repo the index.js file is located in. Then run the command `node index.js`. The user will be prompted with questions about their project to be used in the README. After answering all questions, the README.md file will be dynamically generated for the user in the output directory.
